EXPECTATIONS FOR CMSC 100 

1. To enjoy the time I spend learning about web development.
2. Pass the course and be able to understand all the lessons that I may potentially use on higher CMSC courses.
3. Be able to collaborate with others as and contribute to the project.
4. Have a good overall experience. 

I hope to pass this course while also having fun doing the exercises and project.
I want to develop interest in this area and learn a lot that I can apply in the future. (aguilar)
